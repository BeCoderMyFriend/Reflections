When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you work with others on a project, it is preferable to use the remote repository in order to cut off the extra time
you need to send each an email containing the changes. Or if you want to share a public project, so people can help you and
contribute to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because in my opinion it is always better to choose when to pull new changes in order to avoid conflicts or maybe you just
didn't like to add someone new feature to your local project.
