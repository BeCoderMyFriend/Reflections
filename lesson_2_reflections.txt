What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git will create an empty Git repository for you in the directory where you initialize,
we need to do it so Git will use this repository to track changes to files and to use Git featrues.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is the pipeline between those two, it help us to know which changes to be committed as well as showing untracked files in the working
directory, so without this area Git will never know what changes need to be saved or know if there are untracked files.
